3. Whitespace Analyzer (Expands on 2-7)
Task: Write a Python script where you assign a
string to a variable that includes leading, 
trailing, and internal whitespace (spaces, tabs,
and newlines). 

Create a function that reports 
the count of each type of whitespace at both the
beginning and end of the string, without altering
the original string.

Then, print the string after 
stripping the whitespace.
Key Concepts: String methods, function creation, 
loop or conditional logic.

previous try:
    #string = input("")
    for whitespace in string:
        leading = {}
        leading["' '"] = 0
        leading['\t'] = 0
        n = 0
        if whitespace == ' ':
            leading["' '"]: leading["' '"] + 1

2. Transformative Quote (Enhances 2-5, 2-6)
Task: Choose a quote from a famous person and 
assign it to a variable. Create a function that
 takes this quote and performs the following 
 transformations sequentially: 
 a) converts it to uppercase, 
 b) replaces spaces with underscores,
c) appends the length of the quote at the end. 

Display the transformed quote and ensure your 
function can handle any string passed to it.
Key Concepts: String methods, functions, len() function.
        quote = "To be or not to be"
        expected = "TO_BE_OR_NOT_TO_BE21"

1. Dynamic Greeting (Combines 2-1, 2-3, 2-6)
Task: Write a Python script that assigns a personâ€™s name 
to a variable and a greeting template to another variable. 
The greeting should be a string that expects a name to be 
inserted (use string formatting or concatenation). Initially, 
display the greeting for the first name. Then, update the name 
variable to a different name and display the greeting again with 
the new name.
Key Concepts: Variable assignment, string manipulation, string 
formatting.

4. Mathematical Expressions Generator (Builds on 2-9)
Task: Create a Python program that generates and prints 
four unique arithmetic expressions (using addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division) that result in 
a user-provided number. The expressions must use at least 
two different numbers each (other than the target number) 
and must be generated programmatically (not hard-coded). 
Display the expressions and their results.
Key Concepts: Arithmetic operations, loops, conditional 
logic, input handling.
